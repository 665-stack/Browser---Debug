/* 
What is the different between local storage and session storage ?
==> Local storage has data for very long time.
==> Session storage has date when I'm browsing website.
==> Session storage is similar to Local storage. The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
